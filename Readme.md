### Git Repo Structure:
1. **Frontend Repository**: This repository will contain all the code related to the frontend of the application, including React components, stylesheets, and assets.
   
2. **Backend Repository**: This repository will contain all the code related to the backend of the application, including server-side logic, database models, and API endpoints.

### Project Setup:
1. **Set Up Frontend Project**: Initialize a new React project using create-react-app or any other preferred method. Ensure that you have a clean project structure with necessary dependencies installed.

2. **Set Up Backend Project**: Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Flask) and set up a new project. Configure database connections, routes, and middleware as needed.

### Designing:
1. **Pages**:
   - **Home/Login/Signup Page**: Design a landing page where users can either log in to their existing accounts or sign up for a new account.
   - **Todos Listing Page**: Design a page to display a list of todos. Include options to create new todos, update existing ones, and delete them.
   - **Update Modal**: Design a modal component that allows users to update todo details without navigating away from the listing page.
   - **Other Pages**: Design additional pages as needed for features such as user profile, settings, or project management.

### Features:
1. **Login/Signup**:
   - Implement authentication system with features for user registration, login, logout, and password recovery if necessary.

2. **Listing the Todos**:
   - Fetch todos from the backend API and display them on the todos listing page.
   - Implement pagination or infinite scroll for efficient handling of large todo lists.

3. **Creating Todos**:
   - Design a form component to allow users to create new todos.
   - Validate input fields and handle form submission errors gracefully.

4. **Updating Todos**:
   - Enable users to edit todo details directly from the todos listing page or through a modal.
   - Implement form validation and error handling for update operations.

5. **Deleting Todos**:
   - Allow users to delete todos individually or in bulk.
   - Confirm deletion actions with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.
